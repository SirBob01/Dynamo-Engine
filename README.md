# Dynamo Engine

A 2D game engine powered by SDL2. It holds an in-house 2D physics simulation library.

# Dependencies

This engine wraps around SDL2 and its extensions: SDL_mixer, SDL_ttf, and SDL_image.

# TODO
- Find proper algorithm for calculating collision points between polygons and circles
- Implement edge shape for physics engine
- Implement AABB volume tree for broad phase collision detection
- Improve code documentation
